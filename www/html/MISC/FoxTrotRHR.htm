<p><font size="+3"><strong>Bob in Fox Trot </strong></font></p>
<p>This is a photo of me taken in the early '80s, when Bill Amend was a student 
  at Amherst. You can judge for yourself whether the tough physics teacher in 
  Fox Trot looks anything like me. I have had a serious beard at various times 
  in my life, most recently from about 1070-1984, which includes Bill Amend's 
  time here as a student.</p>

<p>The following sequence of six trips appeared one time for a whole week (Monday-Saturday). 
  That was the first time that I realized that Bill might be using me. He certainly 
  used his experiences as a student in a freshman lab course. My reference to 
  &quot;a little plagiarism here!&quot; is a friendly comment on the fact that 
  I recognize some of my own wording from some Ohm's Law lab notes that I wrote 
  a long time ago.</p>

<p>Here's another one. The desk is recognizably mine - that is, cluttered with 
  physics toys.</p>

<p>The next one I really enjoyed, though it does not picture me nor mention my 
  name. This came out while I was editor of AJP (American Journal of Physics), 
  and I even reprinted it as an editorial: &quot;Jason Fox Reads AJP!&quot;</p>

<p>The next one I would hope doesn't refer to me or to my Amherst colleagues. 
  It's a very pointed comment on how some of our physics labs come across to the 
  students. Rather painful.</p>

<p>And this one was kind of a surprise! &nbsp;&quot;Hunky Bobby Romer&quot;, indeed! 
  This is from May, 2004. One of my former students commented, in an online chat 
  group somewhere, that no one ever called me &quot;Bobby&quot; (true) and that 
  I was never thought of as especially &quot;hunky&quot;. (I can't really speak 
  to the second comment, but my wife seems to think that &quot;hunky&quot; is 
  not so far off the mark.)</p>
