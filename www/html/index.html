<p>I gave a related talk on this subject on Sunday, March 8, 2009.&nbsp; &quot;<strong>Slavery in Colonial Amherst</strong>&quot;.&nbsp; 2:00 P.M. at Hope Church on Gaylord Street in Amherst. (This was part of the town's 250th birthday celebration. More or less the same talk was given again on October 18, 2009 - same time and place.) </p>
<p>I have here various information, professional and personal. My recent research, talks, walking tours on dealing with slavery in the Connecticut Valley of western Massachusetts in colonial time; My &quot;Physics on the Bus&quot; project; History of Physics; Some of my recent (and not-so-recent) books and publications; My c.v.; Miscellaneous biographical and autobiographical notes. Etc., etc. </p>

<p>1) <strong>Slavery in colonial New England</strong> (the Connecticut Valley 
  of western Massachusetts in particular) is something I have been working on 
  for a large part of my so-called spare time since 2001. I have some new information, 
  and I also have been giving a great many talks to a variety of groups as well 
  as giving walking tours of sites (and houses) where enslaved African-Americans 
  lived in the 1700s.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="MISC/Slavery.htm">Connecticut 
  Valley Slavery</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) One of my physics projects is what I variously call &quot;<strong>Physics on the Bus&quot;, &quot;Physics on the Subway (POTS)&quot;, &quot;PhysicsQandA&quot;, or &quot;Thinking About Physics&quot;:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www3.amherst.edu/~physicsqanda">PhysicsQandA</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) In 2003, I was elected to be an officer of the <strong>&quot;Forum on the History of Physics&quot;</strong>, the history branch of the American Physical Society. The following link takes you to the History Forum's webpage: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aps.org/units/fhp/index.cfm">Forum on the History of Physics</a></p>
<p>4) Publications, books, my c.v., other biographical and personal information: 
  <a href="MISC/RHRBio.htm">RHRbio</a> (includes Fox Trot, Shady Hill School, 
  etc.) </p>
<p>5)  I &quot;retired&quot; from the Amherst College faculty in 2001. (I've been here for a while -- since 1955. For the last 13 years on the faculty, 1988-2001, I spent almost all my time being editor of the American Journal of Physics.) A bit more about me (even with a photo) is on the <strong>Amherst College Physics Department site:</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/%7Ephysics/pages/faculty.html#romer">RHR at ACPD</a> (This site has since been revised - Most of the information previously there has gone missing.) </p>
<p>6) <strong>Epitaphs and photographs of the gravestones in the old Deerfield 
  burying ground</strong>. As a library volunteer at Deerfield, I scanned some 
  106 gravestones (those with initial letters A-C, about 1/3 of all the gravestones). 
  I also transcribed the appropriate eptaphs from the Baker &amp; Coleman book 
  and added some genealogical information from Sheldon's history. These were originally 
  intended for the &quot;Digital Deerfield&quot; website; it has now been decided 
  to do that project in a different way, but here for your viewing pleasure are 
  the ones that I finished up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="DD/DDstartMod.htm">Gravestone
