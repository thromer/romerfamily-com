<p class="style1">Slavery in the Connecticut Valley. </p>
<p class="style2">	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Part of Robert H. Romer's website: <a href="http://www.amherst.edu/%7Erhromer">www.amherst.edu/~rhromer</a>) </p>
<p>Since 2001, I have been doing a considerable amount of research on this topic. I also have given a lot of talks, to various groups, and I give walking tours of the sites in Deerfield that I have identified as places where enslaved African-Americans lived in the mid-1700s. If interested, please get in touch with me. Most of what I have to say is news, even to those of us who have lived in the valley all our lives, and I am happy to tell others what I know. I always give out copies of my map showing where slaves lived on the main street of Deerfield in 1752; you can also get a copy by clicking on the appropriate link below. (<strong>And I give talks and walking tours for no charge.</strong>)</p>

<p>Information about some of the talks and walks I have given: <a href="Talks&Walks.htm">Talks 
  &amp; Walks</a> (including the talk with slides that I did during Amherst College reunion on June 1, 2007 </p>
<p>An article I published in 2005 in the <em>Journal of Blacks in Higher Education</em>: 
  &quot;<a href="JBHE-Intro.htm">Higher Education and Slavery in Western Massachusetts</a>&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="http://www.5clir.org">Slavery &amp; Its Legacy</a>&quot; - A 
  series of six sessions, running from Feb. 16 to April 7, 2005, was presented under the auspices of &quot;Five-College Learning in Retirement&quot;. Click 
on the LIR link for program details (<a href="http://www.5clir.org">www.5clir.org</a>) </p>
<p>A little of my collected information, including Reverend Jonathan Ashley's 
  1749 sermon to the Deerfield slaves, a list of known slave-owning ministers 
  from the valley, collected names of enslaved African-Americans who lived in 
  Deerfield from the 1690s until the end of the 18th century: <a href="Historicalinfo.htm">Historical 
  information</a>. </p>
<p>And this is a brief article about my work, my walking tours of the slave sites, 
  etc: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Gazette4A.pdf">Hampshire Gazette article</a></p>
<p>A flier for the &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot; I did at Deerfield on May 11, 2004: 
  <a href="LIR-Announcement(doc).pdf">Slavery &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot;</a> 
  (I did another version of this walk - jointly sponsored by PVMA and PVI - on 
  Oct. 2, 2004.) I have also been giving walking tours of slave sites in old Deerfield 
  to high school classes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a lot of other information that I have collected on this topic, including 
  some xeroxed material that I hand out when I give talks, and in some cases I 
  have written out the essence of my various talks. If interested, send me an 
  email:&nbsp;&nbsp;rhromer@amherst.edu&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Or write me at the Amherst 
  College Physics Department. </p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.sojournertruthmemorial.org">Sojourner Truth</a></strong> -- This does not deal with slavery in the valley (which had gradually come to an end by about 1800 but rather with the following century, the 1800s. By the mid-1800s a flourishing black community had arisen in Northampton (specifically in the village of Florence), and Sojourner Truth lived there for some time. I'm now on the Sojourner Truth Committee, though I only joined the committee several years after its major initial effort - commissioning and erecting a lovely statue of Sojourner in a little park in Florence - had been accomplished. But we continue in other areas, e.g., developing curricular materials for schools, holding an annual essay contest for high school seniors (the prize is a modest contribution to the winners' college expeneses), etc.&nbsp; Though I did not create this website, I have become the committee's &quot;webmaster&quot;, and I try to keep news of current and forthcoming events more or less up to date. </p>
