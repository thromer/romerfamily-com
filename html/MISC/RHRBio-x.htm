<p><strong><font size="+2">My books, a few recent publications, personal stuff, 
  my appearances in the comic strip Fox Trot, and more -- </font></strong></p>
<p>1) My 1976 book (<strong>Energy - An Introduction to Physics</strong>) is out of print, and 
  I have only a very few copies left.</p>
<p>2) My 1985 book (<strong>Energy Facts &amp; Figures</strong>) is still available. This is basically 
  a reprinting of the Appendices to my 1976 book, with the energy data updated 
  through 1983. It also has lots of useful physical information and what I find 
  to be very handy (and 100% reliable!) unit conversion tables (BTU to kwh, miles 
  to meters, etc. etc.). If you would like a copy, send a check for $20 (that 
  includes shipping), made out to me, at the address below. Per copy prices for 
  class size prepaid orders can be negotiated.</p>

<p>4) &quot;<a href="JBHE-Intro.htm">Higher Education and Slavery in Western Massachusetts</a>&quot;, 
  Journal of Blacks in Higher Education, 2005.</p>

<p>6) A review I published in AJP of Aczel's book about Foucault: <a href="Aczel%20Review.pdf">Aczel review</a></p>
<p>7) The American Physical Society has a &quot;<strong>People in Physics</strong>&quot; 
  section, where they occasionally post interviews with various physicists. Here's 
  one they did on me. (This is based on a 2005 interview. I didn't write it;The 
  APS interviewer, Ernie Tretkoff wrote it.) <a href="people-05-02-index.html">APSInterview</a>.
