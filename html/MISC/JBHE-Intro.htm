This is the published version of my JBHE (Journal of Blacks in Higher Education) 
paper. Much of what I wrote was incompatible with JBHE's space requirements and 
vanished in author-editor negotiations over length. More important, JBHE is not 
a journal that goes in for citing of sources. (Much of what I write comes from 
primary sources. What I write about Amherst's Anti-Slavery Society comes almost 
entirely from Robert Brigham's excellent undergraduate thesis.) I also had to 
leave out discussion of such important matters as the uncertainties in my number 
for the enslaved population of Deerfield's main street in 1752. In scientific 
talk, I would say 21 +/- 3, by which I mean that if the true result were anywhere 
in the range, roughly, from 18 to 24, I would hardly be astonished. I am quite 
certain that &quot;about 21&quot; is a correct statment. I also had to omit my 
map, my 1752 &quot;snapshot&quot;, but the article does point the reader to this 
website. The map is available<a href="Map2-150.pdf"> here</a><a href="MISC/150.pdf">,</a> 
and the JBHE article <a href="JBHE-final-Slavery.pdf">here</a>.
