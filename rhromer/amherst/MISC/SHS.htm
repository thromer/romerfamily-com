  <p align="left">I don't list it on my c.v., but the best school or college I 
    ever went to was Shady Hill School in Cambridge, Mass. (where I grew up). 
    SHS was a K-9 school (now unfortunately only K-8). I wish that I had started 
    in K, but in fact I was only at SHS for 7-9, an excellent three-year stretch, 
    though. There were good friends among my classmates, and truly wonderful teachers. 
    I never &quot;do reunions&quot; (have never attended a single one at my undergraduate 
    college), but I make an exception for Shady Hill. In 1995, I attended my 50th 
    reunion there, and in 2005 my sixtieth. I post the following picture because 
    the supposed 1945 graduation photo of our class, the one that the school currently 
    has posted on the wall at the school, is not correct. I wish I could find 
    a print of the correct photo. The one below isn't from a print but from a 
    low-resolution photo that was printed in the SHS alumni news in 1981. Maybe 
    I can get a better one. I know of at least one person missing: Alan Wood, 
    who came to Cambridge in the fall of 1942 as a refugee child from England. 
    Perhaps by the time of our graduation in May or June, 1945, he was already 
    on his way home.</p>
