<p>The text that follows is an approximation of what I said on June 1.&nbsp; Because this talk was given at an Amherst College reunion, I included near the end quite a bit of Amherst College iniformation from the 19th century and beyond.</p>
<p>And since I had a computer projector available, I used it to include a Power Point slide show along with the talk. </p>
<p>These are the Power Point slides that I showed on June 1 &ndash; </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thank you  for that generous introduction.&nbsp; And I  want to thank the class of 52 for sponsoring this session.&nbsp; Before I begin, I want to thank my financial  supporters:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seriously,  not only has Amherst College paid me quite well for many years, but in the last  few years (partly because of my own agitation),&nbsp;  the college has begun to take more seriously the idea that emeritus  professors continue to have scholarly interests.&nbsp; Amherst  has paid my expenses to go to physics conferences, and &ndash; more to the point &ndash;  the college gave me a modest grant to support my research into slavery here in  the valley.&nbsp; I have a lot of other things  to thank Amherst  for as well, not the least being good students and good colleagues.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What I want  to do today is to take you for a walk (unfortunately, a <em>virtual </em>walk).&nbsp; (You should  have received a map when you came in.)&nbsp;  First, though, I want to tell you how I got into this subject.&nbsp; When I retired 6 years ago, I decided to try  being a house guide at Historic Deerfield.&nbsp;  The house I chose to learn about was the home of the minister, Jonathan  Ashley.&nbsp; The minister was usually the  most important man in town, so that would give me the best chance of learning  about history.&nbsp; I thought I knew a lot  about our local history.&nbsp; I did, but it  turned out that I was almost totally ignorant of one very important part of it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as  I began looking into the story of Reverend Ashley, I learned that he owned 3  black slaves.&nbsp; This was not at all an  original discovery on my part, but it was a surprise to me.&nbsp; The minister &ndash; a slave owner!&nbsp; This, I&rsquo;m thinking, is more interesting than  old furniture, and I began digging out everything I could find about slavery in  the valley.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, before  I go on, let me deal with a misunderstanding that often comes up when I begin  to talk about this subject.&nbsp; People often  think I&rsquo;ll be talking about abolitionism and the Underground Railroad.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll have a bit to say about the 1800s later,  but, no, I&rsquo;m talking about <em>slavery, </em>right  here, in colonial times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To set the  stage, let me read a legal document from 1750, the record of a transaction  between two local residents.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Slide  5&nbsp; &ndash; Ephraim Williams bill of sale</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="EphWilliamsBillof Sale 2a.jpg" width="900" height="309" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For and in consideration of the sum  of two hundred and twenty-five pounds old tenor, to me Ephraim Williams Jr.  well and truly paid by Israel Williams of Hatfield, I do hereby assign, sell  and convey to him a certain negro boy named Prince aged about nine years, a  servant for life, and do hold him and&nbsp; his heirs against the claims of any  person whatsoever as witness my hand this 25th day of September anno  Domini 1750.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephraim  Williams, Jr.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you  weren&rsquo;t listening carefully, you might have just heard a lot of legal jargon  conveying a piece of property from one owner to another.&nbsp; And of course it <em>was </em>&ldquo;just a piece of property&rdquo; &ndash; the property was a <em>nine-year old Negro boy</em>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We&rsquo;re  talking about slavery, right here in the Connecticut  Valley, here in Amherst,  and especially along the river in towns such as Hadley, Northampton,  Hatfield, and Deerfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ephraim  Williams &ndash; I wonder whether anyone here recognizes the name of the signer of  that bill of sale.&nbsp; Williams died in  battle 5 years later, and in his will he left some money that eventually led to  the founding of Williams   College.&nbsp; He still owned slaves at the time of his  death, and in the same document, his will, there is this passage:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I give and  bequeath unto my beloved brothers my homestead, with all the Buildings and Appertenances thereunto belonging, with all the Stocks of  Cattle and Negro Servants.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fact  that Williams was a slave owner is not prominently displayed in the college&rsquo;s  publicity brochures, but neither is it a secret.&nbsp; The complete text of his will is on the Williams College website. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Those  documents &ndash; that bill of sale, that will &ndash; should convince any skeptic that  slavery &ndash;&nbsp; owning,  buying, and selling human beings &ndash; went on right here in colonial times. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I  started looking into this subject, for a while I was just collecting scraps of  information from here and there.&nbsp; In  trying to organize what I was learning, I had what turned out, I think, to be  an inspiration.&nbsp; I decided to focus on a  particular <strong>time</strong> and a particular <strong>place</strong> and to make what I call a &ldquo;<strong>snapshot</strong>&rdquo; of slavery, a map that shows  who lived where and who they belonged to, on a particular street at a  particular moment in history.&nbsp; As far as  I know, no one has ever made such a map of a New England  street before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><a href="Map2-150.pdf">Slide 6 &ndash; Map</a>.</strong> &nbsp;I chose a <strong>date</strong> of 1752,&nbsp;&nbsp; 250 years ago.&nbsp; And the <strong>place</strong> I chose was the main street of Deerfield.&nbsp; So with this map in hand (a map unlike any  that you&rsquo;ll be given as a tourist), let&rsquo;s go for a walk.&nbsp; First, let&rsquo;s go 15 miles up the river, to the  main street of what is now Old Deerfield.&nbsp;  And now let&rsquo;s go back in time 250 years, to an early July morning in  1752.&nbsp; I want to walk up the street with  you and introduce you to some of the people I&rsquo;ve been learning about for the  past 6 years.&nbsp; As we walk, I&rsquo;ll need to  step back from time to time into the 21st century, to tell you some  of the things I&rsquo;ve found out about the people we&rsquo;re going to meet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we begin  our walk, the first person we meet is Titus. Titus is a slave, the property of  Daniel Arms, and he&rsquo;s on his way to work on one of Arms&rsquo;s  farm lots, down by the river. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several  houses farther up the street, in front of Samuel Dickinson&rsquo;s house,  we meet a young woman coming out to draw water from the well.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know her name; all I know of her  comes from Dickinson&rsquo;s  lengthy probate inventory, which reads in part &ndash; </p>
<p><strong>Slide  7.</strong><strong>&nbsp; Excerpt from Samuel Dickinson's probate inventory</strong>.</p>

<p align="center"><img src="Nancy Dawson.jpg" width="1344" height="286" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next  house is the home of Caesar, who is not in evidence this morning &ndash; probably  already at work in the fields<strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong>Across the street is the imposing home  of Humphrey, Cesar, and Phillis,&nbsp; &ndash;&nbsp; <strong>Slide 9 &ndash; Champney  house &mdash;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="jsw_img_1380-champney.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3 black slaves who belong to  Timothy Childs. Humphrey was baptized earlier this year, but I don&rsquo;t know  anything else about him.&nbsp; Phillis is one of 3 young women who used to belong to  Nehemiah Bull, the minister of Westfield,  but were sold to new owners in various towns when Bull died 10 years ago.&nbsp; There is also another Cesar who lives  here.&nbsp; I have to apologize for the fact  that you&rsquo;ll be hearing about 5 different Cesars this  morning.&nbsp; When I first began to meet  these people, I found it difficult to keep them straight.&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the slaves who live here have no  surnames, and that makes it difficult to remember who&rsquo;s who, especially because  the Deerfield owners seem fond of assigning  cute classical names such as Cesar, Titus, and Cato to their slaves.&nbsp; But as you get to know them, you begin to  realize that they are all different individuals, with their own histories,  their own lives, their own hopes and disappointments. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we go  farther up the street, we see a young woman, about 25 years old, working in the  garden behind Ebenezer Wells&rsquo;s house.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ndash; <strong>Slide  10 &ndash;&nbsp; Wells-Thorn</strong> <strong>house</strong> &mdash;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><img src="jsw_img_1373wt.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is Lucy Terry, the only one of the  Deerfield slaves who uses a surname, though it&rsquo;s only a name taken from that of  her former owner in Enfield, Connecticut.&nbsp;  Six years ago a war party of Indians raided Deerfield, and five Deerfield men were killed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy composed a poem about that event, a  poem that she often recites.&nbsp; She will  eventually become known as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s  First Black Poet&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. Wells also owns  a male slave, Caesar (the 3rd Caesar we&rsquo;ve met so far this morning), about whom  very little is now known.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farther up  the street, we see a man (I don&rsquo;t know his name) working in front of Major Williams&rsquo;s store, one of two slaves that the Major  owns.&nbsp; This reminds me of something I  should have told you about earlier, when we met Titus, Daniel Arms&rsquo;s slave.&nbsp;  Sometime last year, Titus and several of his fellow slaves decided (in  the words of Pliny Arms, a descendant of Daniel) &ldquo;to have a frolic.&nbsp; They pilfered rum from the store of Major  Williams, eggs butter and bread from some pantry, and chickens from some  hen-roost and met at some place of resort to cook their meal and enjoy themselves.&rdquo;&nbsp; They  were discovered and taken to the town whipping post, (here on the common, right  in the midst of what is now Deerfield Academy), where &ldquo;Titus, Daniel Arms&rsquo;s negro, was the first drawn up.&nbsp; His back was laid bare and Major Catlin plied  with all his force the cat-gut&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Undoubtedly there were other occasions on which slaves (and others) were  whipped, but this is the only surviving written description of a whipping in Deerfield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Near the  common we meet Deerfield&rsquo;s minister, Reverend  Jonathan Ashley, walking with his two male slaves, Cato &ndash;&nbsp; a boy of 14 &ndash; and Titus &ndash; a grown man  of 25.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashley often rents Cato and  Titus to various Deerfield farmers;&nbsp; indeed, one of  those to whom Ashley occasionally rents Cato and Titus is Abijah  Prince, the one <em>free </em>black in town &ndash;  and that is where Cato and Titus are headed today.&nbsp;&nbsp; In  Ashley&rsquo;s account book, he refers to Abijah Prince as  &ldquo;Abijah Negro&rdquo;, as if &ldquo;Negro&rdquo; were Abijah&rsquo;s last name.&nbsp;  (Point out a couple of entries with laser.)&nbsp; <strong></strong><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Slide 11 - Excerpt from Jonathan Ashley's account book, showing amounts owed to Ashley by &quot;Abijah Negro&quot; for work done by Ashley's two male slaves, Cato and Titus. </strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="JA-AccountBook-Abijah-W5.8.jpg" width="1230" height="728" />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ashley is  not the only minister who owns slaves.&nbsp;  In fact, most of the ministers in this valley own slaves:&nbsp; John Williams, Ashley&rsquo;s famous predecessor in  Deerfield, owned two slaves who were killed during the big French and Indian  raid back in 1704 and bought two more when he returned from captivity in Canada.&nbsp; Abijah Prince used  to be the property of Benjamin Doolittle, minister of Northfield,  Jonathan Edwards of Northampton owns several  black slaves, so does David Parsons, my own minister down in Amherst, and there are many other slave  owning ministers in the valley.&nbsp; I began  to collect slave-owning ministers from the valley; at last count, I had  21.&nbsp;<strong> </strong>By now,  it&rsquo;s surprising to me when I find a colonial minister who was <em>not </em>a slave owner.&nbsp; (You&rsquo;ll notice that about half of these  ministers graduated from Harvard, the rest from Yale.&nbsp; And not one, I am pleased to say, graduated  from Amherst.)</p>
<p><strong><a href="MinistersDatabaseModB.htm">Slide 12 -- Slave-owning ministers from the valley</a>. </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reverend  Ashley (a formidable looking man, only 40 years old but already described as  &ldquo;venerable&rdquo;) is not someone to be trifled with.&nbsp;  Ashley has occasionally given a special sermon to the assembled slaves  of the town, in which he explains at length that slavery is perfectly in accord  with the Bible and that they <em>may </em>become  free in the <em>next </em>world, but, as  Ashley tells them:<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &ldquo;You must be contented with your  State &amp; Condition in <em>this </em>world  and not murmur and complain of what God orders for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Farther up  the street, just before we go down a small hill, we pass Joseph Barnard&rsquo;s  house&nbsp; (in the 20th century the official residence of Deerfield Academy&rsquo;s Head of School).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is where Barnard&rsquo;s slave Prince (not to  be confused with <em>Abijah</em>Prince), used to live.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Slide 13 - The &quot;Manse&quot; </strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="jsw_img_1352manse.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p> Prince ran away in 1749, and Barnard placed  an advertisement in a Boston Newspaper &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Slide 14 &ndash; Runaway ad.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="RunawayAd-PVMA-2.jpg" width="648" height="338" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prince <em>was </em>brought  back to Deerfield, but just a month ago, in  June of this year, he passed away, and Barnard paid carpenter James Couch 2  pounds to make him a coffin.&nbsp; But where  Prince was buried no one knows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As we go on  up the street we pass the homes of more Deerfield  slaves, some of whom we see at work around their owner&rsquo;s houses.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Slide  15 &ndash; Dr. Williams house</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p align="center"><img src="jsw_img_1340-ourpoor.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>There is a young woman here who belongs to  the town doctor,&nbsp;  Thomas Williams.&nbsp;&nbsp; She is  known to us only as &ldquo;our poor Negro girl&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp;  That is how she was described in a 1757 letter (the only known letter  that even <em>mentions </em>any of the town&rsquo;s  slaves), where Dr. Williams, who has treated several of the town&rsquo;s slaves,  wrote:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &ldquo;Our poor Negro girl is yet living  after 36 days confinement with the Slow fever; her Case Appears as yet very  dubious, her blisters much canker&rsquo;d, turniped, &amp; threaten a Mortification, thro the acrid, putred &amp; Alkaline State of her blood, &amp; <em>medicines have not (nor ever had in my  practice) much sensible effect upon that Nation.&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><strong>Slide 16 &ndash; &ldquo;Our poor Negro girl...&rdquo; letter.</strong></p>
<p align="center"><img src="Our poor.jpg" width="1172" height="522" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then  there is Ishmael, two more Caesars, and Mesheck.&nbsp; Mesheck has been  moved around town during his time here, as the property of 4 different owners  in succession.&nbsp; First he belonged to  Reverend John Williams, and when Williams died in 1729, his probate inventory  listed &ldquo;the Molatto boy Mesheck&rdquo;,&nbsp; right in the midst  of the furniture and the dishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesheck then became the property of Williams&rsquo; daughter  Sarah, who died at an early age a few years later.&nbsp; (Town gossips say that she had expected to  marry the new minister, Jonathan Ashley, but &ldquo;died of a broken heart&rdquo; when he  married someone else.)&nbsp;&nbsp; Mesheck then passed into the possession of another Williams daughter, Abigail, and when Abigail married  Ebenezer Hinsdale, he became Hinsdale&rsquo;s  property.&nbsp;&nbsp; (When a woman married in  those days, all her property &ndash; furniture, silverware, slaves, cows, everything  &ndash; automatically became that of her husband.)<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally,  across the street is Reverend Ashley&rsquo;s house. </p>
<p><strong>Slide 17 &ndash; Ashley house</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;  </p>
<p align="center"><img src="jsw_p1170023-ashley.jpg" width="400" height="300" /></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve already met his two male slaves, Cato and Titus, and now you see  Jenny, Cato&rsquo;s mother, out drawing water from the well behind the house.&nbsp; Jenny was born in Africa, captured as a young  girl and brought to Boston,  where Ashley bought her, together with her baby, in 1738.&nbsp; During her many years in Deerfield, Jenny  collected buttons and shells to take back to Africa  with her.&nbsp; She never made it, of course,  but lived out her long life in Deerfield.</p>
<p><strong><a href="Map2-150.pdf">Slide 18 &ndash;&nbsp; The map again</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making this  map, this 1752 &ldquo;snapshot&rdquo;,&nbsp;  has completely changed what goes through my head when I drive up  that street.&nbsp; Not just beautiful old  houses, but I see in my mind Titus, and Caesar, and Phillis,  and &ldquo;Black Negro Wench&rdquo;, and all the others.&nbsp;  And I can&rsquo;t help thinking that some of those houses, probably, were  built &ndash; in part &ndash; by slaves.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve been  fortunate enough to meet many of the 21 slaves who lived on that street in  1752.&nbsp; These are people that most Deerfield visitors never meet or even hear about. To  borrow Ralph Ellison&rsquo;s term, these are the <em>invisible  men (and women) </em>of our colonial past.&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Twenty-one slaves on this mile-long street,&nbsp; a surprisingly  large number, one that contradicts the received wisdom that there were never  more than a very few slaves here at any one time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough so that there was probably a real  black community embedded in the majority white community.&nbsp; Although the numbers were certainly smaller  in outlying areas (and of course the numbers were much larger in the southern  states), I maintain that the enslaved blacks played a very significant role in  many western Massachusetts towns, not just Deerfield, of course, but in other  prosperous valley towns such as Springfield, Hatfield, Hadley, and  Northampton.&nbsp; Any discussion of colonial  times here in western Massachusetts that does not include the slaves is  misleading, incomplete, and just plain <em>wrong </em>&ndash; just as wrong as if there were no mention of women, children, and Native  Americans.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is so  much, though, that we <em>don&rsquo;t </em>know  about the slaves and the lives they led.&nbsp;  We don&rsquo;t even know where they slept or where they ate.&nbsp; We have almost nothing but a&nbsp; few legal documents &ndash; all, of course,  written by their white owners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even for  Jenny, the Deerfield slave I know best, we  have only three contemporary documents.&nbsp;  One is Ashley&rsquo;s will,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with a sentence  that goes like this: &ldquo; I give, devise, and bequeath to my beloved wife Dorothy  Ashley my riding chair, my grey mare, two cows &amp; ten sheep, also my easy  chair, all the silver utensils which she brought with her at our marriage,&nbsp; my Negro woman servant Jenny, and also one half  of all my household furniture...&rdquo;, and so on.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Slide 19 &ndash; Ashley's will </strong>&ndash;</p>
<p><img src="AshleyWill-3.jpg" width="1300" height="500" /></p>
<p> The second is an entry in the account book of shoemaker Zadock Hawks in which we read that Elihu  Ashley, the minister&rsquo;s son, once paid him a shilling to fix Jenny&rsquo;s shoes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash; The third is from the death records of 1808 (deaths of  blacks were not even recorded in the 1700s):&nbsp;  &ldquo;Jenny, a black woman, age 90, killed by a fall.&rdquo;&nbsp; No one knows where she was buried.&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Slide  20 &ndash; Death record</strong>.</p>
<p align="center"><img src="Death Record w arrow-2.5.jpg" width="750" height="566" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have to  confess that I have become emotionally involved with Jenny.&nbsp; (Betty, my wife, says she&rsquo;s OK with this.)&nbsp; Now I know it&rsquo;s irrational, but it still  makes me angry that the Ashley family, with whom Jenny had lived for <em>70 years </em>&ndash; most of that time as a slave  &ndash; wouldn&rsquo;t pay for even a small gravestone.&nbsp;  (Well, they did fix her shoes, give them credit for that.&nbsp; And in her old age, when she was probably no  longer useful, they did not do as they might have done, tell her she was now  &ldquo;free&rdquo; and then put her out on the street.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometimes  people say to me that here in the valley &ldquo;it was not <em>really </em>slavery, that they weren&rsquo;t slaves but servants, that they  were well treated, that they were &lsquo;just like members  of the family&rsquo; &rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, &ldquo;servant&rdquo; <em>was </em>the common term used for black slaves  in colonial times, and it may be comforting to us to think that they were &ldquo;just  servants&rdquo; and not slaves.&nbsp; But legally  and in owners&rsquo; minds they were <em>property</em>,  just like the furniture and the livestock.&nbsp;  They were not &ldquo;just members of the family&rdquo;.&nbsp;&nbsp; They did not choose to come here, for them  there was no light of freedom at the end of the tunnel,  their children automatically became slaves like their parents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And  families could be separated by sale.&nbsp;  Ashley bought Jenny and Cato together.&nbsp;  But not every baby (or mother) was so fortunate.&nbsp; Here is a 1759 advertisement from a Boston newspaper:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A Negro woman about 24 years of  age, fit for town or country business, and a Negro girl about 7 years of age,  both healthy and have had the smallpox [that&rsquo;s a plus] &ndash; to be sold, <em>together or apart. </em>&ldquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [I don&rsquo;t find it easy to read those words.]</p>
<p>And another one, from 1756: </p>
<p>&ldquo;To Be <em>Given Away</em>, two Negro Children, one a boy, the other a girl,  neither of them a fortnight old.&rdquo; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be sure,  there were differences between slavery in Massachusetts  and slavery in South Carolina.&nbsp; But once one realizes that here in the  Connecticut Valley some people <em>owned </em>other  people, that slaves were simply property, listed as such on tax rolls and  probate inventories, that families could be and were separated by sale, then  the differences between one region and another seem less significant than the  basic similarities.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slavery here in the  picturesque &ldquo;Pioneer   Valley&rdquo; really <em>was </em>slavery. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now let me  say a bit about modern times, that is, after about 1800, by which time slavery  had gradually disappeared in Massachusetts  &ndash; though not in many other northern states. During the 19th century,  here in Massachusetts we began to practice  what I call &ldquo;deliberate amnesia&rdquo;, remembering the &ldquo;good stuff&rdquo; &ndash; the  abolitionist movement, the Underground Railroad, the Massachusetts  54th regiment that fought and largely died at Fort Wagner  in 1863 -- while managing to forget that slavery itself had ever existed  here.&nbsp; (I could show you an example of deliberate  falsification of the historical record in an attempt to erase that inconvenient  truth.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first  Anti-Slavery Society in Massachusetts was  founded in 1823 at Williams   College.&nbsp; Here at Amherst,  the students formed an Anti-Slavery Society in 1833.&nbsp; Amherst  at that time in fact had <em>two </em>societies  dedicated to ending slavery, one way or another.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Anti-Slavery Society&rdquo; was regarded as  extremely radical by the faculty and a majority of the students.&nbsp; The second society was called the &ldquo;Amherst College  and Amherst <em>Colonization </em>Society&rdquo;.&nbsp; By the fall of 1834, about one third of the  students were members of the Anti-Slavery Society, but they were forced to  disband after President Humphrey informed them that &ldquo;the Society was alienating  Christian brethren, retarding and otherwise injuring the cause of religion in  College, and threatening in many ways the prosperity of the Institution&rdquo;.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although  there was at least some anti-slavery agitation at all three of the western Massachusetts colleges (Williams, Mount Holyoke,  and Amherst), few if any &ndash; students or faculty &ndash; seemed ready to welcome freed  slaves into American society as equals.&nbsp;  And the view of the colonizationists was that  everyone, black and white, would be better off if the blacks were liberated and  promptly sent to Africa.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Amherst&rsquo;s first black  student, Edward Jones, graduated in 1826, shortly after the college was  founded. But the number of black students remained very small for well over a  century. Our second black student, Wiley    Lane, did not graduate until 1879.&nbsp; In the early 1900s, though the numbers were  small, several prominent blacks graduated from Amherst: Charles Houston (1915),  a leading civil rights lawyer; William Hastie (1925), the first black federal  judge;&nbsp; Benjamin  Davis (1925), elected to the New York City Council in 1943, a leader in the  American Communist Party, indicted under the Smith Act in 1948;&nbsp; Charles Drew (1926), a prominent surgeon and  medical researcher; Rick Haynes (1952), Ambassador to Algeria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In my own entering class in 1948, there were  two black students.&nbsp; (The generally  accepted and all-too-plausible rumor was that every class was supposed to have  two black students, who could then be assigned as room-mates.)&nbsp; In 1948, the Amherst chapter of a national fraternity, Phi  Kappa Psi, made headlines by pledging a black  student.&nbsp; Threatened with expulsion from  the national fraternity, the undergraduates stuck to their guns and were indeed  expelled, forming a local fraternity, Phi <em>Alpha </em>Psi, instead.&nbsp;  It seems like such a small thing now, but in 1948 asking a black student  to join an all-white fraternity made national news.&nbsp; Much has changed for the better during the  last half century.&nbsp; The first black  faculty member, Jim Denton, was appointed in 1964.&nbsp; Amherst  fraternities, local as well as national, have, thankfully, disappeared.&nbsp; Of the 413 students who entered Amherst four years ago as  members of the class of &lsquo;07,&nbsp;&nbsp; 49 (12%)  were African-Americans.&nbsp; And  approximately 50% of the entering students were women; that, too, is a welcome  change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A couple of final comments.&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>Why </em>am I spending so much time  looking into 18th century history?&nbsp;  The pay, after all, is lousy.&nbsp;  Well, historical research is indeed fun, just like physics research,  especially at those moments when you find out something no one else knows  because you haven&rsquo;t told them yet.&nbsp; And I  have learned that history research is harder than physics research.&nbsp; In physics, if the experiment doesn&rsquo;t work or  gives ambiguous results, you usually have a chance to take more data or redo  the experiment &ndash; not so with history.&nbsp;  But there&rsquo;s more to it and the fun of research.&nbsp; As I&rsquo;ve grown up, I&rsquo;ve realized more and more  how little I learned in school, how so much of what I learned was wrong, and  how large a role the terrible institution of slavery has played in the founding  and the history of our country.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; William  Lloyd Garrison, our passionate 19th-century abolitionist editor,  understood that.&nbsp; &ndash; <strong>Slide 21- Garrison (1) </strong>&ndash; Prominently featured on page 1 of every  issue of his weekly newspaper, the <em>Liberator</em>,  was the statement: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Slide 22&nbsp; &ndash; Garrison (2)</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The United States Constitution is  a covenant with death, and an agreement with hell.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>

<p>&ndash; in a Fourth of  July speech in 1852 to the  Rochester, New York Ladies' Anti-Slavery Society &ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Could  abbreviate this</strong>.&nbsp; (As in bold below)</p>
<p><strong>This Fourth of July is yours, not mine.&nbsp;  What, to the American slave, is your 4th of July?</strong>&nbsp; <strong>I  answer: a day that reveals to him, more than all other days in the year, the  gross injustice and cruelty [of] which he is the constant victim. To him, your  celebration is a sham; your boasted liberty, an unholy license; your national  greatness, swelling vanity; your sounds of rejoicing are empty and heartless;  your shouts of liberty and equality, hollow mockery; </strong>your prayers and  hymns, your sermons and thanksgivings, with all your religious parade, and  solemnity, are, to him, mere bombast, fraud, deception, impiety, and hypocrisy &mdash; <strong>a thin veil to cover up crimes which  would disgrace a nation of savages. There is not a nation on the earth guilty  of practices, more shocking and bloody, than are the people of these United States,  at this very hour.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And it was  not just a matter of supposedly virtuous Yankees having had to compromise with  evil southerners in writing the Constitution.&nbsp;  In the 18th century slavery was just as <em>acceptable </em>here as it was down south.&nbsp; Most of the ministers in the valley were  slave owners.&nbsp; So were many of the other  important people &ndash; judges, military officers, successful merchants. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The  after-effects of slavery didn&rsquo;t miraculously go away in 1865 or in 1954.&nbsp; I think it&rsquo;s&nbsp; important to know as much about it as  we can, to realize how widespread it was, that it wasn&rsquo;t just a regional  phenomenon that we can blame on the southerners. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of <em>course </em>there were regional  differences.&nbsp; But once one understands  that the basic obscenity of one human being owning  another human being was not only legal but almost universally approved of and  accepted even here in the valley, one begins to appreciate how embedded slavery  is in our history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish that  were not true.&nbsp; But it is.&nbsp; At the end of the American Revolution,  slavery was legal and practiced in every one of the original 13 states.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Skip this  for now.&nbsp; This belongs earlier, if at  all.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I must say that I have  very little patience with those who say &ndash; &ldquo;Well, we have to understand that  things were different back then&rdquo;.&nbsp;  Slavery is wrong now and it was wrong then, and those ministers, deep down  inside, <em>knew </em>it was wrong. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing the history of slavery and  understanding how central a role it played in the history of our country can  help us to deal with its continuing legacy. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go visit Deerfield.&nbsp; Take my  map with you.&nbsp; And think about those  houses and who lived in them.</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<p>Of the many talks that I have given on slavery in the  valley, this is the first one in which I had some accompanying Power Point  slides.&nbsp; For the most part, these slides  were a mixture of colonial-era documents and photographs of some of the  existing Deerfield houses in which slaves  lived in colonial times.&nbsp; To me, it makes  a real impression to be standing in front of the &ldquo;Ashley House&rdquo;, for instance,  and thinking: &ldquo;This is where Jenny and Cato and Titus lived, right here on the  spot where I am standing now&rdquo;.&nbsp; But  photos are not the same as actually being there.&nbsp; My wife, Betty   Romer, opined after the talk that using the house photos this  way was not the best way to do it.&nbsp; The  houses are indeed handsome, and this might give the listener and viewer the  subconscious impression that perhaps the slaves&rsquo; lives weren&rsquo;t so bad.&nbsp; Perhaps another time, if I use the house  photos at all, I might first show a few house photos, say that this is the  Deerfield that tourists these days actually see, and then say that I am now  going to show another and very different version of reality.&nbsp; The documents, Betty thinks (and I agree) are  devastating, especially when you see something like the original 18th-century  handwriting on a bill of sale or a probate inventory &ndash; Let&rsquo;s be careful not to  detract from the impression they convey.</p>
