<p align="center" class="style1">Talks &amp; Walks</p>
<p>I'm happy to give talks (for no charge!), and especially to give walking tours of slave sites in Deerfield.</p>
<p>Here are notes for a couple of recent talks:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A talk (with accompanying PowerPoint slides of houses and documents) that I gave during the <a href="ACTALK-2.html">Amherst College reunion weekend on June 1, 2007 </a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A talk to the Western Massachusetts Library Club (WMLC) at 
  a meeting they held in Whately: <a href="WMLC%204-27-05-Mod3-web.htm">WMLC</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very brief talk I was invited to give at the second annual 
  celebration in Florence (Massachusetts) for the installation of the Sojourner 
  Truth statue. Sojourner Truth was the focus of the event, but I talked about 
  another black woman, Jenny, who lived in the valley nearly a century before 
  the time of Sojourner: <a href="Sojourner%20Truth-%20ModforWeb.htm">Jenny</a> 
</p>
<p>A flier for the &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot; I did at Deerfield on May 11, 2004: <a href="LIR-Announcement(doc).pdf">Slavery &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot;</a> (I have done other  versions of this walk - for instance, one on October 2, 2004, which was jointly sponsored by PVMA and PVI, the Pioneer Valley Institute.) I have also been giving walking tours of slave sites in old Deerfield to high school classes.</p>
<p>&quot;<a href="https://fclir.org/">Slavery &amp; Its Legacy</a>&quot; - A 
  series of six sessions, running from Feb. 16 to April 7, 2005, was presented under the auspices of &quot;Five-College Learning in Retirement&quot;. Click 
on the LIR link for program details (<a href="https://fclir.org/">fclir.org</a>) (I was one of many speakers. We hope to post transcripts of all the sessions on the LIR website.)</p>
<p>And this is a brief article about my work, my walking tours of the slave sites, 
  etc: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Gazette4A.pdf">Hampshire Gazette article</a></p>
