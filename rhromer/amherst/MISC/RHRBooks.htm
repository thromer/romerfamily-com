<p>My books and a few recent publications:</p>
<p>1) My 1976 book (Energy - An Introduction to Physics) is out of print, and 
  I have only a very few copies left.</p>
<p>2) My 1985 book (Energy Facts &amp; Figures) is still available. This is basically 
  a reprinting of the Appendices to my 1976 book, with the energy data updated 
  through 1983. It also has lots of useful physical information and what I find 
  to be very handy (and 100% reliable!) unit conversion tables (BTU to kwh, miles 
  to meters, etc. etc.). If you would like a copy, send a check for $20 (that 
  includes shipping), made out to me, at the address below. Per copy prices for 
  class size prepaid orders can be negotiated.</p>

<p>4) &quot;The Spin-Statistics Theorem&quot;, American Journal of Physics 70 
  (8), 791 (2002). A letter to the editor, trying to correct the record on previous 
  publications in AJP on this topic.</p>
