<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I have given quite a number of talks on the general topic of slavery in the
Connecticut Valley &#8211; to various groups: school groups, teacher workshops, historical
societies, etc.  Also, I have given a number of walking tours of known slave sites on the
old main street of Deerfield &#8211; and a few &#8220;virtual walking tours&#8221;, when (because we are
somewhere else) we pretend to take a walk along the street.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>The talks are always different, but this is one that I gave to the WMLC. (At any
rate, it&#8217;s an approximation of what I said) </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>I almost always give out a bunch of handouts for people to take home with
them.The list of the ones I gave out to the WMLC is at the end of this document. 
Sometimes I show a few overhead transparencies.  At the WMLC, I used four
transparencies: my map of the street, my list of slave-owning ministers, a page from
Ashley&#8217;s account book showing his rentals of Cato and Titus to Abijah Prince (listed by
Ashley as &#8220;Abijah Negro&#8221;), and Shamek Weddle&#8217;s sketch of the plaque that we plan to
put on the wall of the PVMA museum in Deerfield.</span></span></p>

the historical record by Carpenter &amp; Morehouse (in their 1896 Amherst history), which I
might have used if an appropriate question had been raised.<span style="font-size: 14pt"><span style="font-weight: bold"></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Starting several years ago, after a long time teaching physics at AC,  I&#8217;ve been
spending about half my time on the history of <span style="font-weight: bold">Slavery in Western Mass</span>. </span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>How did I get into this?   I decided to look into becoming an occasional house
guide at Old Deerfield.   Although I&#8217;m a physicist by profession, I&#8217;ve always been
interested in local history, and I thought I knew something about the Connecticut Valley
in colonial times.  I did &#8211; but it turned out that I was almost totally ignorant of one very
important part of the story.</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Because of my interest in colonial history, I chose to learn about the home of
Jonathan Ashley, who was Deerfield&#8217;s minister for almost half a century, from 1732-1780.  (The house up at the north end of the street.)</span></span></p>
<br>
<p><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">&#160;<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As the minister, Ashley was almost by definition the most important man in town. 
He was a serious Calvinist, a farmer as well as a minister, father of 9 children, and an
outspoken Tory during the Revolution.  AND &#8211; As soon as I started seriously studying
Ashley&#8217;s life, I was astonished to learn that he owned 3 black slaves.  This was not at all
an original discovery &#8211; But it was news to me, and because it was news &#8211; and because,
perhaps like many of you, I had spent my share of time on civil rights marches and vigils
(and I taught for a while at a black college in the south) &#8211; I got interested and began
digging out everything I could find about slavery in the Connecticut Valley. <span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<br>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I visited libraries and other places up and down the valley, accumulating
information. The one best place: PVMA library in Deerfield.  (But there are others &#8211; some
that I haven&#8217;t yet really visited.)  I have found out some new things.  But New England
slavery, it turns out, is much harder to find out about than southern slavery simply because
it ended earlier here, and so &#8211; other things being equal &#8211; a will or a bill of sale or a family
letter is much less likely to have been preserved.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">I learned that David Parsons, minister of Amherst (where I live) also owned 3
black slaves.  So did John Williams, Ashley&#8217;s predecessor in Deerfield.  In the famous
1704 attack on Deerfield, Williams&#8217;s wife and several of his children were killed.  So
were his two slaves, and he and the rest of his family were marched off to captivity in
Canada.  When Williams was ransomed, he became minister at Deerfield again, (wrote a
best-seller: .....) and acquired both a new wife and new slaves.  His son, Stephen, (the hero
of &#8220;Boy Captive of Old Deerfield&#8221;, a book that I devoured as a child) was also ransomed,
went to Harvard, and became minister at Longmeadow, where he too bought slaves.   
Jonathan Edwards, Northampton&#8217;s minister  &#8211; everyone has heard of him &#8211; also owned
slaves. (His predecessor in Hamp, Solomon Stoddard, was not a slave owner, as far as I
can tell.)   I began to &#8220;collect&#8221; slave-owning ministers from the Valley &#8211; at last count I had
20. (Note the Vugraf.)  (Note Yale, Harvard, none from Amherst.)    It seems that almost
every minister in the valley who could afford it owned a few slaves.   (My own New
England minister ancestors?)  And if any ministers had qualms about slavery, they kept
pretty quiet about it. In other words, slavery was just as <span style="text-decoration: underline">acceptable</span> here as it was down
south.  Of course, it was not just the ministers, most of the &#8220;important people&#8221; in the
valley &#8211; judges, military leaders, .... the most prosperous merchants and farmers.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">When word got around about what I&#8217;d been learning, I began to be invited to talk
to various groups.  What I have to say is news to most of my neighbors, and almost
everyone is interested and wants to know more.  I &#8216;ve been doing some workshops with
school teachers (PVMA), and I&#8217;ve been  giving <span style="font-weight: bold">walking tours </span>of slave sites in Deerfield
to kids from Frontier Regional and to other groups.  I think it makes the subject so much
more <span style="font-weight: bold">real</span>, to know that one is looking at real houses where enslaved African-Americans
<span style="font-weight: bold">lived </span>250 years ago.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Before going on, there are three misconceptions about this subject that I
want to address.  First, when I start to tell people what I&#8217;m doing, they often think I&#8217;m
researching the &#8220;Underground RR&#8221;.  That is a fascinating topic, but that was in the next
century, the 1800s. That&#8217;s a part of our New England history that we like to remember, the
heroic efforts to help slaves escape from the south.  But what I&#8217;m talking about is the
1700s, and I&#8217;m talking about slavery right here, where we live &#8211; something that I think
many of us New Englanders have been actively trying to <span style="text-decoration: underline">forget</span> for the last 200 years.</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Second, there may be an impression that the numbers were very small and
therefore slavery was not important here.  I&#8217;ll return to the numbers in a minute &#8211; they&#8217;re
<span style="font-weight: bold">larger </span>than most people realize &#8211; but the mere fact that so many <span style="text-decoration: underline">ministers</span> owned slaves
tells us that slavery was not unimportant. </span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Third, sometimes people say: &#8220;Well, they weren&#8217;t <span style="font-weight: bold">really </span>slaves, they were
just servants, they were well treated, and they were just like members of the family.&#8221;  
Sometimes they do appear on property lists as &#8220;servants&#8221;, sometimes as &#8220;servants for
life&#8221;, sometimes as &#8220;slaves&#8221; and sometimes simply as &#8220;Negroes&#8221;.  </span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Well, the idea that New England slavery was quite benign is an old notion. Let me
read a bit from an 1893 book. (Earle.)<span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">From Alice Morse Earle, Customs and Fashions in Old New England (1893), pp.
90-91.<span>&#160;</span>&#8220;The [New England] ministers were <span style="font-weight: bold">kind </span>to the blacks, <span style="font-weight: bold">preaching special
sermons to them</span>....&#8221;   ... She goes on:   &#8220;In the main, New England slaves were not
unhappy, for they were well treated, and <span style="font-weight: bold">the race has the gift to be merry </span>in the worst of
circumstances.&#8221;</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">Yes, the ministers did preach &#8220;special sermons&#8221; to the slaves.  We have the text of
one such sermon that Jonathan Ashley gave to the Deerfield slaves.  An outline of that one
is one of the items in the handouts I&#8217;ve passed out.  The basic message is ....  (Include this:
The Bible approves of slavery.  And  <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8220;You must be contented with your state and
condition in this world and not murmur and complain of what God orders for you.&#8221;</span> 
That is, You may get to be free in the next world, but only if you don&#8217;t even <span style="font-weight: bold">think </span>about
while you&#8217;re in this world.  Wasn&#8217;t it truly kind of Jonathan to give the Deerfield slaves
the benefit of those words of wisdom?  (Or - I&#8217;m not sure I would describe that sermon as
&#8220;kindness&#8221;.)</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">That quote from Earle was from 1893, but the illusion about the nature of slavery
in the North is still with us.   They were <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> &#8220;just members of the family&#8221;.   They did not
choose to come here, for them there was no light of freedom at the end of the tunnel, they
were listed as <span style="text-decoration: underline">property</span> along with the furniture and the cows and horses, they could be
and were sold apart from their children, and &#8211; this is important &#8211; their children
automatically became slaves like their parents.</span></span></p>

read a couple of items.  First, a legal document from 1750:</span></span></p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-left: 1in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">For and in consideration of the sum of two hundred and twenty-five pounds

standard legal jargon conveying a piece of property.  And of course it <span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> &#8220;just a piece of
property&#8221; &#8211; it so happens that the property in question was &#8220;a nine-year old negro boy&#8221;.  </span></span></p>

money that eventually led to the founding of Williams College.  In the same document, his
will, he left to his brothers the slaves he still owned at the time of his death in 1755.  This
is something I don&#8217;t think they publicize much up in Williamstown now.</span></span></p>

information about slavery (here) in the Valley.  Then, I had what turned out, I think, to be
an inspiration.  I decided to focus on a particular <span style="font-weight: bold">time</span> and a particular <span style="font-weight: bold">place</span> and to make
what I call a &#8220;<span style="font-weight: bold">snapshot</span>&#8221; of slavery.</span></span></p>

And the <span style="font-weight: bold">place</span> I chose was the main street
of old Deerfield.  Why Deerfield?  Simply because, of all the towns in the area, there are
probably more surviving documents and letters from Deerfield than from any of the
others.  Even for Deerfield, though, there is so much that has been lost.</span></span></p>

think about what it means,  make copies for your friends, whatever you wish.   <span style="font-weight: bold">As far as I
know, no one has ever done this to a New England street before</span>.  Take this map with
you next time you visit Deerfield.   As a tourist, you won&#8217;t be offered this kind of guide to
the town &#8211; (at least <span style="font-weight: bold">not yet</span> &#8211; maybe that will change).</span></span></p>

information.  I really wish there were something like a 1752  &#8220;street list&#8221;.  I&#8217;m sure you all
know about the wonderful document that every town now produces, the annual street list,
in which you can look up not only the names of your neighbors but also their occupations
and ages (unless, of course, they lie). (I never lie about my age, but I sometimes get a bit
creative about my occupation.)</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>There <span style="text-decoration: underline">are</span> no &#8220;street lists&#8221;.  (If there were, they wouldn&#8217;t include the slaves
anyhow, who were legally treated just like the livestock and the furniture.)  My slavery
snapshot is based on <span style="text-decoration: underline">many</span> sources &#8211; probate inventories, church records, a few surviving
tax lists, wills, store account books, an ad for a runaway, bills of sale, the extremely rare
family letter that mentions a slave, <span style="text-decoration: underline">and</span> &#8211;  some educated <span style="font-weight: bold">guesswork</span>.  By that I mean, for
instance, that if &#8220;Ishmael, servant to Thomas Dickinson&#8221; bought a pair of knee buckles at
Elijah Williams&#8217;s store in 1749, then I&#8217;ll put him on my 1752 map &#8211; unless I then learn
that he was sold in 1751.  But a similar entry for, say, 1744, is a bit too early and wouldn&#8217;t
qualify him for my map.  I had to make several judgment calls like that.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">\<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>My map shows 21 black slaves, belonging to 12 different owners, living on that
street in 1752.  (I also show Abijah Prince, Deerfield&#8217;s one free black.)   21 slaves, 7% of
the total population of about 300.  Especially because of my scientific training, I feel
obliged to estimate the uncertainty in that number.  In physics talk, I would say 21 + 3. 
By that I mean that if we could somehow have revealed to us &#8220;the truth&#8221;, it would not
surprise me to learn that the true number was as low as 18 or as high as 24, but much
beyond that range, I would begin to wonder how I could have gone wrong.</span></span></p>

come from 1748, say, and in fact that person, unbeknownst to me, might have died or
been sold in 1750.  But my number is even <span style="text-decoration: underline">more</span> likely to be too <span style="text-decoration: underline">low</span>, because in quite a
few cases my knowledge of an individual comes from a <span style="text-decoration: underline">single</span> surviving piece of paper.  If
that piece of paper hadn&#8217;t come down to us, we wouldn&#8217;t know that he or she had ever
existed, and so &#8211; obviously &#8211; there may well be others of whom <span style="text-decoration: underline">no</span> record has survived.</span></span></p>

physics is easier than history. (I&#8217;m serious.)  In physics, if the data are missing or

through my head when I drive up that street. When I see those handsome houses that have
survived from colonial times, I realize that  it is highly probable that some of them were
built, in part, by slaves.   And now I can&#8217;t help imagining myself back in 1752, and I find
myself thinking: This is where Titus lives, a few houses up is the home of &#8220;Negro wench
and two children&#8221;, over there is where Phyllis and Humphrey and Cesar live.  <span style="font-weight: bold">Real </span>people,

First, the <span style="text-decoration: underline">numbers</span>. As I said
before, it shows 21 slaves on this mile-long street &#8211; at <span style="text-decoration: underline">one</span> time!   Not just 1 or 2, but 21. 
That&#8217;s a <span style="font-weight: bold">lot</span>. Surprising even to my historian friends.  Enough so that there must have been
a real black community embedded in the majority white community.  A Deerfield tourist
these days may never hear a word about the enslaved black population, or may hear about
just <span style="font-weight: bold">one</span>, Lucy Terry (about whom much has been written), and that is in some ways even
more misleading than no mention at all.  (&#8220;Picking on Deerfield&#8221;?  No, I just happen to
know more....)   I maintain that the enslaved blacks were an important part of <span style="font-weight: bold">many
</span>western Massachusetts towns, (not just Deerfield, of course, but Hatfield and Hadley and
Springfield and Northampton,), and that any discussion of colonial times in western
Massachusetts that does not include the slaves is misleading, incomplete, and simply
<span style="font-weight: bold">wrong </span>&#8211; just as wrong as if there were no mention of women and Native Americans.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Second, what is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> on my map?  My map gives a pretty good idea of the raw data
&#8211; numbers, names, owners, a few birth and death dates.  But what is <span style="text-decoration: underline">not</span> here because
neither I nor anyone else has practically any information at all is anything about their <span style="text-decoration: underline">life</span>. 
What did they do, did any of them have a chance to become literate, what was the nature of
their interaction with their owners, with their owners&#8217; families, with each other?  What did
they do for recreation?  Where did they sleep?  What about sex?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>

I&#8217;d like to tell you about a Greenfield case that I rarely
mention in public &#8211; because, especially for those for whom the mere existence of slavery
here is a brand new idea, this is just <span style="font-weight: bold">too </span>upsetting. Lucy &amp; Caesar ... (Summarize the
documents in the handouts.)   I don&#8217;t mean to present this a frequent occurrence &#8211; this is
one that made it into the court records, and so we know about it, whereas for the most part
we know very little about sex or any other aspect of their daily lives.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>

I&#8217;d like to illustrate how little we know about their
lives with a few extreme examples.  Take Cesar, for instance, the one who belonged to
Samuel Childs, down near the lower righthand corner of your map.  He served in the
French &amp; Indian war in the 1750s. That&#8217;s it. That is <span style="text-decoration: underline">all</span> I know about Cesar. I can make a
rough guess from that about his age.  Maybe I will come across an entry in a store account
book sometime, but for now, there is nothing else I can tell you about him.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>

very much &#8211; let&#8217;s look at the Reverend Ashley&#8217;s 3 slaves: Jenny, Cato, and Titus.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Ashley probably bought Jenny, along with her baby Cato, in Boston, about 1739,
but there is no documentary evidence of that.  As far as I know,  there are just <span style="text-decoration: underline">three</span>
contemporary pieces of paper that mention Jenny.   One is Ashley&#8217;s 1780 will, in which
there occurs the memorable sentence: &#8220; I give, devise, and bequeath to my beloved wife
Dorothy Ashley my grey mare, two cows &amp; ten sheep, also my easy chair and my Negro
servant woman Jenny&#8221;.  (There&#8217;s Jenny, right in with the cows and the sheep and the
furniture.)  The second one is an account book in which Elihu Ashley, the reverend&#8217;s son,
recorded an expense for fixing Jenny&#8217;s shoes. The third mention of Jenny is in the church
death records.  In the 1700s, slave deaths were not even recorded, but Jenny lived until
1808  --  by which time slavery was really over in Massachusetts --  and her death <span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span>
recorded as (quote) &#8220;Jenny, a black woman, age 90, killed by a fall&#8221;. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>As for Jenny&#8217;s baby Cato, we know that Cato was baptized by the Rev. Ashley in
1739 and died in 1825, with his death being listed simply as &#8220;Cato, a man of colour, 87,
died of old age.&#8221;  But who was Cato&#8217;s father?  And who was Jenny&#8217;s previous owner? 
Perhaps Jenny&#8217;s previous owner <span style="text-decoration: underline">was</span> Cato&#8217;s father?</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>

Ashley bought Titus in 1750, from
one Samuel Kendall of New Salem (the <span style="font-weight: bold">minister </span>&#8211; no surprise there), and sold him in
1760.   (Those documents turned up, of all places, in the Norman Rockwell museum (!) out
in Stockbridge.)  </span></span></p>

something about how Cato and Titus spent their time. <span style="font-weight: bold"> </span>There are many pages in Ashley&#8217;s
account book (like this one &#8211; note Vugraf) in which he recorded how he rented out Cato
and Titus to various Deerfield farmers, showing how much they owe him for &#8220;Titus &amp;
Cato, &#189;  a day &#8216;houghing&#8217; &#8220;, or &#8220;Titus, two days sugaring&#8221;, and so on.  One of the local
farmers to whom Ashley rented Cato and Titus was listed as &#8220;Abijah Negro&#8221;.  That was
Abijah Prince, Deerfield&#8217;s one free black, who was himself formerly the property of the
Northfield minister.  (Note new Gerzina biography, next September.)</span></span></p>

about many of the enslaved blacks of Deerfield, there is so much we don&#8217;t know. Deerfield
tradition says that Jenny was born in Africa, but we really can&#8217;t be certain of that.  What
did Jenny <span style="text-decoration: underline">do</span> in the Ashley household?  We can <span style="text-decoration: underline">guess</span>, but we don&#8217;t know. How was she
treated by the good Reverend?  What was her interaction with the Ashley family?  With the
other Deerfield slaves?   Did Jenny have a love life during her long years in Deerfield? 
Did Cato?  Did Cato have friends among the other slaves with whom, perhaps, he went
fishing on an occasional day off?  Cato was baptized as a baby &#8211; Did he go to church? 
Was he <span style="text-decoration: underline">required</span> to go to church?  Where did they all sleep and eat?  We don&#8217;t even know
<span style="text-decoration: underline">that</span>. </span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>

mention of any of the slaves.  In fact, the almost total <span style="text-decoration: underline">absence</span> of letters mentioning <span style="text-decoration: underline">any</span> of
the Deerfield slaves is itself revealing of their place in this society.  The lack of surnames
and the frequent use of the same classical names &#8211; you&#8217;ll find 5 &#8220;Cesars&#8221; on my 1752 map
&#8211; adds to the difficulty of finding out even who was who on the Deerfield street. (Note list
of names in handouts, and show Vugraf.)   And there are a number of cases where we have
no names at all.  Part of Samuel Dickinson&#8217;s inventory, for instance, reads:  &#8220; pair of
Saddle Bags 12 shillings,  Horse Collar 3 and 6,  Negro Wench &amp; 2 Children  30 pounds, 
2 Bushels &amp; 3 pecks Wheat 11 shillings&#8221;, etc. </span></span></p>

Very possibly in a corner of the old
Deerfield  cemetery, but we don&#8217;t <span style="text-decoration: underline">know</span>.  Jenny died in 1808, still living with the Ashley
family.  Deerfield tradition says that Jenny collected buttons and shells to take back to
Africa with her; she never made it, of course, at least not in this life. I wonder what
happened to those buttons and shells.  Dorothy Ashley, Jonathan&#8217;s widow, outlived
Jonathan by 28 years and died in 1808, in the same month as Jenny. (I sometimes say to
visitors that, knowing Jonathan as well as I do, those were probably the happiest 28 years
of their lives, for both Jenny and Dorothy.)   Dorothy has a nice big gravestone, you can
easily find it in the cemetery, but if there ever was a marker for Jenny, it was an
impermanent one of wood, long since gone.   I confess that I have become emotionally
involved  with Jenny (Betty, my wife, knows about this and she&#8217;s OK with it), and &#8211;
though I know it&#8217;s not rational &#8211; it still makes me angry that the Ashley family, with whom
Jenny had lived for <span style="text-decoration: underline">70</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">years</span> (most of that time as a slave) wouldn&#8217;t put up the money for
even a small gravestone.   (Well, they did fix her <span style="font-weight: bold">shoes</span>, give them credit for that.)</span></span></p>

slavery is a subject that is now (unlike 20 years ago) talked about.  It was so obviously
important there that they can&#8217;t avoid it any more.  Even at Phillipsburg Manor in New
York state. ( But not at Deerfield &#8211; <span style="font-weight: bold">not yet</span>. ) <span style="font-weight: bold">QUIZ</span>: (I <span style="font-weight: bold">am </span>a professor, after all.) &#8211;  There
are a vast number of markers and monuments and tablets and old gravestones in Deerfield. 
How many of them mention the enslaved African-Americans who lived there in the 1700s? 
<span style="font-weight: bold">None</span>.  To borrow a term from Ralph Ellison, our enslaved African-Americans are the
&#8220;invisible men (&amp; women)&#8221; of colonial times in the valley.  ( Ralph Ellison&#8217;s famous 1952

When I&#8217;ve given talks on this subject, I have often
mentioned this lack of public recognition. And a while back, some PVMA staff members
who came to a talk of mine picked up on this idea, Tim Neumann called me up, and just
within the past few months, we have had some meetings at PVMA, a bunch of us (some
black, some white),  to talk about how to fix this. We will start with a plaque on the wall at
the PVMA museum, (Shamek&#8217;s <span style="font-weight: bold">sketch </span>- explain drum ),  later probably an outdoor
sculpture, a walking tour brochure, and this being the 21<sup>st</sup> century, some sort of interactive
computer display.   I am excited about our belatedly recognizing in a public way this
important part of the Deerfield community.<span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>

WHY am I spending so much time looking into 18<sup>th</sup> century
history?  It <span style="font-weight: bold">is </span>sort of fun looking, through old documents (usually in vain), just as physics
is fun, but beyond that &#8211; As I&#8217;ve grown up, I&#8217;ve realized more and more how little I
learned in school, how so much of what I learned was wrong, and how large a role the
terrible institution of slavery has played in our country.  Its after-effects didn&#8217;t
miraculously go away in 1865 or in 1954.  I think it&#8217;s  important to know as much about it
as we can, to realize how widespread it was, that it wasn&#8217;t just a <span style="font-weight: bold">regional </span>phenomenon that
we can blame on the southerners, but that it was just as much <span style="font-weight: bold">accepted </span>out here in western
Massachusetts as it was in South Carolina or Mississippi.<span>&#160;</span></span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in">&#160;</p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>Of course there were regional differences.  But once one understands that the basic
obscenity of one human being owning another human being was not only legal but almost
universally acceptable here, and that husbands and wives, parents and children, could be
and were separated by sale, one begins to appreciate how embedded slavery is in our
history.  Knowing the history may give us a slightly better chance of dealing with its
legacy.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">If there are questions about ending of slavery in Mass, tell them about &#8220;deliberate amnesia&#8221;
in the 1800s, and in particular, my discovery of what Carpenter &amp; Morehouse did.  Here&#8217;s
a paragraph about it from a talk I gave to the Amherst Historical Society -</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-left: -0.05in; margin-right: -0.0625in"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif"><span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span>And after the end of slavery here, <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">it seems that we in Massachusetts set about
&#8220;forgetting&#8221; as rapidly as possible that the slavery had ever existed here.  We like to
remember the &#8220;good things&#8221;, such as the &#8220;Underground Railroad&#8221;.  I discovered a striking
example </span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif">of New Englanders&#8217; deliberate amnesia on the subject of slavery by comparing a
passage in Carpenter and Morehouse&#8217;s 1896 <i>History of Amherst </i>with the original
document on which it is supposedly based. Carpenter and Morehouse print what purports
to be a portion of a 1759 Amherst tax valuation list.  It shows columns for &#8220;Polls [i.e., adult
white males], Horses, Oxen, Cows, Hogs, Sheep, Personal Estate, Houses and Lands, and
Real Estate&#8221;.  Because of what I had seen of other tax lists from the 1700s, it seemed to me
that there was something missing from the Carpenter and Morehouse version.  Sure
enough, when I finally discovered the original document (at Jones Library &#8211; thanks, Tevis
Kimball &amp; Kate Boyle), it was just what had been reproduced in the 1896 book <i>except </i>that
the original contained one additional column, between &#8220;Sheep&#8221; and &#8220;Personal Estate&#8221;: 
&#8220;Negro&#8221;. The omission of that one column cannot possibly have been an accident!   There
are many histories of towns from this area that were published in the late 1800s.  In most
cases, little or no mention is made of the existence of slavery in colonial times. (George
Sheldon&#8217;s 1895 <i>History of Deerfield </i>is an honorable exception, with an 18-page section on
&#8220;Negro Slavery&#8221;.)  But the Amherst history is the only one I have found that contains an
apparently deliberate falsification of an historical document.<span>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</span></span></span></span></p>
