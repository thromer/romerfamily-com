<p>&quot;<a href="https://fclir.org/">Slavery &amp; Its Legacy</a>&quot; - A 
  series of six sessions, running from Feb. 16 to April 7, 2005, has been organized 
  under the auspices of &quot;Five-College Learning in Retirement&quot;. Click

<p>Click the following link for my map of slavery on the main street of Deerfield, 
  1752: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Map2-150.pdf">Slave site map</a></p>
<p>And this is a brief article about my work, my walking tours of the slave sites, 
  etc: &nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="Gazette4.pdf">Hampshire Gazette article</a></p>
<p>A 2005 article in Journal of Blacks in Higher Education: &quot;<a href="JBHE-Intro.htm">Higher 
  Education and Slavery in Western Massachusetts</a>&quot;</p>
<p>A flier for the &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot; I did at Deerfield on May 11, 2004: 
  <a href="LIR-Announcement(doc).pdf">Slavery &quot;Talk &amp; Walk&quot;</a> 
  (I did another version of this walk - jointly sponsored by PVMA and PVI - on 
  Oct. 2, 2004.) I have also been giving walking tours of slave sites in old Deerfield 
  to high school classes.</p>
<p>Reverend Jonathan Ashley's 1749 sermon to the Deerfield slaves: <a href="JASermon-full.htm">Full 
  version (reprinted from an 1867 journal)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="SlavSermonOutlilne.pdf">My 
  outline</a> </p>
<p><font size="4"><strong>Ever since I began seriously studying slavery in western 
  Massachusetts, I have been struck by the total lack of public recognition of 
  the existence of slavery here. Initially at my instigation and with the strong 
  support of the leadership of &quot;PVMA&quot; (the Pocumtuck Valley Memorial 
  Association - the group that runs the museum in Deerfield and works with local 
  history teachers and students), we have begun to take steps to rectify this 
  situation. Here is our February, 2005 &quot;<a href="African%20American%20Monument%20vision%20statement%202.3.05%20(with%20intro).htm">Vision 
  Statement</a>&quot; of the plans of our committee.</strong></font></p>
<p><font size="2">M</font>ore: My list of slave-owning <a href="MinistersDatabaseModB.htm">ministers</a> 
  from the valley. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collected 
  <a href="SlaveNamesSortRevised-9-04.htm">names</a> of Deerfield's enslaved blacks.</p>
<p>I have a lot of other information that I have collected on this topic, including 
  some xeroxed material that I hand out when I give talks, and in some cases I 
  have written out the essence of my various talks. If interested, send me an 
  email:&nbsp;&nbsp;rhromeramherst@gmail.com&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Or write me at the Amherst 
  College Physics Department. </p>
